            "In order to arrive at knowledge of the motions of birds in the air,
            it is first necessary to acquire knowledge of the winds, which we will prove by the motions
            of water in itself, and this knowledge will be a step enabling us to arrive at the knowledge
            of beings that fly between the air and the wind." - Leonardo da Vinci

            </div>
            <div class="description-holder">
              <p>I am a curiousr. I am not anymore curious than the next person and my curiosity isn't motivated
              by answers; it's the questions hiding behind the answers that empower a curiousr.</p>
              <p>Silly name tags aside, knowledge about anything creates a sort of intimacy which surrounds that thing.
              The more I learn and know about guitar, the more the guitar allows me to explore and create in ways I couldn't
              have with a less developed knowledge of the guitar. It's almost symbiotic: the guitar itself is a mystery,
              or adventure, and more than it just being a muse -- it is a means of expression. Now, when I pour my
              energy and time into learning about the guitar, I'm allowed to tap into what the guitar is providing.
              So as I grow in my knowledge, the things I can do with my knowledge also grow.</p>
              <p>Alright, enough of the esoteric philosophies. My name is Quinton and I've spent my whole life thinking
              way too much. From time to time I put it to good use, but as a whole I could probably have spent some of
              that time in much better ways. Recently, I've been working in Information Technology as a project manager
              and consultant. That's been the gig for almost 3 years now. Prior to that I went to school at the
              University of Arkansas and studied Physics and Mathematics. While at the U of A, I worked in the
              Quantum Transport Group; a research group that studied the ballistic transport of electrons in a graphene
              medium -- that's really fun to say, and I still haven't figured out why. My whole life I've played music.
              Well, my whole teen and adult life. I play guitar mostly, but I also play piano, trumpet, and a few others.
              Music is my go to stress reliever. I have some tunes up somewhere if any of you would like to check it out, just
            let me know and I'll be glad to get you some links.</p>
              <p>I think this'll do it for now. Feel free to reach out, I always love a great conversation.</p>
